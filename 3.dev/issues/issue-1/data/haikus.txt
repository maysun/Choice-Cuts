1. The Breakfast Club
One weekend morning
five very different students
must write one essay

2. Ratatouille:
A pretentious rodent
finds himself in the kitchen
stewing on the dish

3. Willy Wonka
Never-ending taste
New berries and three-course gum
One man's creations

A kid inherits
An empire of sugar just (chocolate)
For being golden

A poor English chap
A meticulous owner
One golden moment

A strait-laced recluse
A poverty-stricken youth
A golden moment

A family in need
Their one chance for a new life
A milk chocolate bar

A quintet of kids
Four fall because of their greed
One rises for good (gets a business)
